## Description

This is a sandbox where I publish leetcode (and other) problems solutions, play around with the topics I'm interested in etc.

Clone of one of my [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/data-structures-6q8yw).

## Scripts
| Command              | Purpose                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn`               | Install dependencies.                           |
| `yarn start`         | Serve the application at http://localhost:1234  |
| `yarn build`         | Build the app                                   |

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies.
2. Run dev server.
3. Edit `src/index.ts`: import the function you want to play around with.
4. Call `showOutput` function with function and its parameters to see the output on the page.
